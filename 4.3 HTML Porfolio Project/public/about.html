<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Kelly Doran. I am 41 and I am an absolute beginner to coding. I can't say that it is something I have always wanted to do, but since starting, I have really enjoyed learning so much.I am a wife and a mom of 4 kids. I love doing anything crafty and will pick up new crafts, master them and get bored. I guess you could say I am a collector of hobbies. I really enjoy being home, but I husband knows that it's not always the best for me so he creates new and exciting adventures for us to go on so I'm not holed up at home. I live a very blessed life and am grateful to be learning something new every day. </p>
