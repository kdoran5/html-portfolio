 <h1>Top Movies of All Time According to Kelly</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Favorites</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Pride and Prejudice(BBC Version)</h3>
 <p>This 6 hour version is so satifying because it really describes each character and is the closest account to the books</p>
 <h3>While You Were Sleeping</h3>
 <p>This is definitely a classic for me. It makes me laugh and smile and I like to quote this movie with my sisters</p>
 <h3>You've Got Mail</h3>
 <p>Definitely another classic for me. I love movies based on books. I love the wit in this movie and who doesn't love a Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks movie?</p>
